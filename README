Project description: (Also, what image did you draw?)

In this project, I used SFL 2.0 to draw several shapes of different colors and render them in a 9:16
window for a user. My project creates a yellow couch with a background of a blown up circle with a blue->red->blue
gradient fill and has transparent bars throughout it at uniform intervals to give the circle a cooler look. In my opinion
though, the coolest part of this is the "sound byte" looking two-color offset lines going across the top.
It took a lot of trial and error for them to look like this, but they're my best attempt at random generation of a
 sound byte -esque graphic. NO TWO offset pairs are ever the same!

The easiest part of this project: Thanks to you providing some basic primative shape classes,
I was able to get help by referencing some of your class structures and SDL usage.

Problems that I had in completing this project:

My biggest problem was getting the "sound byte" lines to
look like sound bytes. It took a lot of trying different intervals and odds for when different aplitudes would
be randomly chosen. It was a very enjoyable challenge though. I'm very happy with the end result.

I really enjoyed this project in general. I shouldn't have put it off so long, but I feel that I came out
with something I'm really happy about. Cheers!
