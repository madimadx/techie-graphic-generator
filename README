I created a program that uses SDL2.0 to generate an image with 3 main components: 

1. two offset lines that are randomly generated each compile-time to create a unique sound byte -esque pattern

2. a circle with an outside->center gradient and intermittent horizontal black transparency bars

3. a 2d couch
